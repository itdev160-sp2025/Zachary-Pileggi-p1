        <p>
            Sakamoto Days is a fun, innovative and action-packed story. Though it may sound 
            familiar to stories such as the <em>John Wick</em> series, where Sakamoto Days stands
            out is by taking a more comedic approach. Author Yuto Suzuki expertly blends lighthearted
            comedy and captivating action. Theres also one more twist. Taro Sakamoto has promised to his 
            wife that he will never take another person's life ever again. As hit men and assassins come 
            after Sakamoto day-in and day-out, he must come up with creative solutions on the fly in order to
            pacify the trouble at hand and maintain his peaceful life.
